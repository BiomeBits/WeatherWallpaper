# About

This is a little script that allows you to change your desktop wallpaper to a different video depending on the time of day and the weather.
It requires Lively Wallpaper, and the command utility.
You will also need an API key from OpenWeather.
Full instructions are included.

Premade videos of a scene in Skyrim can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xF0Iz6BP_f_UGSkXBAFqbQ5xHxR2msvC?usp=share_link).

Thanks to rocksdanister and the [Lively](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) contributors for making Lively and the command utility that my script relies on.

## Known Issues
Sometimes if the task scheduler task isn't configured properly, the cmd terminal will pop up and minimise full screen games. Make sure you configure the task properly, or disable while you play.
